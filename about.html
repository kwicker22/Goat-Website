        Stan Lee will forever be known for his impact on the cinematic and comic
        universe. He will always be a legend. He had transformed comic book
        landscapes and made his mark. Stanley Martin Leiber was born in New York
        City on December 28, 1922. He has always loved story telling from a
        young age and and transformed it to the epic platform it is today. He
        started his career at Timely Publications, a precursor to Marvel Comics,
        in 1939. It was in the early 1960s when his career took off in
        incredible leaps. Stan Lee started with the iconic creation of
        characters such as, Spider-Man, the X-men, Iron Man, the Incredible
        Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Thor, and many others to follow. Stan's
        version of superheroes were unlike any before his time due to the
        ability to related to their character for their flaws and real-life
        problems.

        By 1972, Stan Lee was the face, voice, publisher, and editorial director
        which he held on for decades. During his creative and executive
        leadership Marvel Comics expanded into animation and television and
        created the cultural icons that we know as Marvel characters. Stan made
        the most significant impact to pop culture and is well known for his
        entertaining cameo appearances making him more relatable to the average
        fan. Which brings me to my conclusion that the Greatest of all Time
        would be no other than Stan Lee. Rest in Peace.
